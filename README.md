# LearningR: Practicing awesomeness

This project...

# Brief description of folder and file contents

This is practice code for the R course in June 2021

The following folders contain:

- `data/`: -
- `doc/`: -
- `R/`: different code files

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using `usethis::use_package("packagename")`
through the `DESCRIPTION` file, installing dependencies is as easy as opening the
`LearningR.Rproj` file and running this command in the console:

    # install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_deps()

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.

documentation.
